The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.\n\nFor example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:\n\n\n\nYou are given the following sequences:\n\n\n$\\def\\htmltext#1{\\style{font-family:inherit;}{\\text{#1}}}$\n$\n\\begin{align}\n\\qquad t_0 &= 123456,\\cr\n\\qquad t_i &= \\cases{\n\\;\\;\\frac{t_{i-1}}{2},&$\\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\\htmltext{ is even}$\\cr\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\oplus 926252,&$\\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\\htmltext{ is odd}$\\cr}\\cr\n&\\qquad\\htmltext{where }\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\htmltext{ is the floor function }\\cr\n&\\qquad\\!\\htmltext{and }\\oplus\\htmltext{is the bitwise XOR operator.}\\cr\n\\qquad b_i &= (t_i\\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\\cr\n\\end{align}\n$\n\n\nThe first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and $b_2 = 145$.\nIf we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls, $3419100$ moves would be required to finish the game.\n\nConsider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.\n";
