The first sexy pair is (23, 29).\n\n\nWe may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first member of the next pair.\n\n\nWe shall call a number n such that :\n(n-9, n-3), (n-3,n+3), (n+3, n+9) form a triple-pair, and \nthe numbers n-8, n-4, n, n+4 and n+8 are all practical,\n \nan engineers\u2019 paradise.\n\n\nFind the sum of the first four engineers\u2019 paradises.\n\n\n\n";
